# jQuery context menu

jQuery plugin that shows a custom context menu when right clicking something. Super simple implementation. Used to modify visualization of the form analytics metrics for [RevRise Form Analytics](http://revrise.com "Web Form Analytic tool"), but can be used in pretty much any context as long as jQuery is present.

For questions, either [follow me](http://twitter.com/arnklint "Follow Jonas Arnklint") on twitter or post an issue here.

## Basic calling syntax:

    // context_menu_id becomes the id of the context menu, context_menu_items contains the items to be shown in the menu, and options is a set of options for this menu
    $(selector for elements that will launch the menu).contextMenu( context_menu_id, context_menu_items, options );

A complete example:

    $("selector").contextMenu('context-menu-1', {
        'Context Menu Item 1': {
            click: function(element){  // element is the jquery obj clicked on when context menu launched
                alert('Menu item 1 clicked');
                element.css({backgroundColor: 'pink'}); // just as example the clicked items background is changed
            },
            klass: "custom-class1" // a custom css class for this menu item (usable for styling)
        },
        'Second menu item': {
            click: function(element){ alert('second clicked'); },
            klass: "custom-class2"
        }
      },
      {
        delegateEventTo: 'childrenSelector',
        disable_native_context_menu: true,
        showMenu: function() { alert("Showing menu"); },
        hideMenu: function() { alert("Hiding menu"); },
        leftClick: true // trigger on left click instead of right click
      }
    );


## Markup, and css

All context menus gets the class 'context-menu', so it´s quite easy to keep a consistent look over multiple menus. The look is all up to you and the structure of a menu looks like this:

    <ul id="contextMenu" class="context-menu">
      <li class="custom-class1"><a href="#">Context Menu Item 1</a></li>
      <li class="custom-class2"><a href="#">Second menu item</a></li>
    </ul>

Style it however you want with CSS, it does not come with any predefined styles so thats completely up to you.

## Callback

In the example above, when a user clicks on the first context menu item, the original element that launched the context menu is passed in as the only argument for the click callback. Thus, we can make the clicked element green by doing this:

    clickFirstItem = function(element){
        element.css({color: "green"});
    }

    $(".targets").contextMenu({
        'Context Menu Item 1': {
            click: clickFirstItem,
            klass: "menu-item-1"
        }
    });

Simple, yet powerful.
